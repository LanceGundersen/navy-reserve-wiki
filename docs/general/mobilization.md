## RE-EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS 
The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994 provide certain employment/re-employment rights to all citizens who serve in the military. USERRA protects the rights of involuntarily mobilized reserve component and National Guard members.  Many employers and employees, however, do not know that USERRA also protects the employment rights of service members who volunteer for active duty via mobilization, ADSW, ADT, or any other military orders.  USERRA also provides certain protections for normal IDT weekends including time off and reasonable rest periods before and after drill periods.  Additional information can be found at http://www.esgr.org.

## ESGR RECOGNITION PROGRAMS 
The National Committee of Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) sponsors an awards program designed to recognize employers for employment policies and practices that are supportive of their employees' participation in the National Guard and Reserve.  All employer recognition and awards originate from nominations by individual Reserve component members. Depending on the degree of support, the level of recognition may rise to the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award.  Employer awards include:  Patriot Award Certificate of Appreciation, Above and Beyond Award, Pro Patria Award and Employer Support Freedom Awards (http://www.FreedomAward.mil).
