# Command Services

The Command Services Department promulgates NOSC and Navy policies.  Some of their responsibilities include:

## PLAN OF THE MONTH (POM)
Every month the NOSC publishes a Plan of the Month that gives updated points of contact, news, schedules, and uniforms.  The POM is published before the drill weekend and may be available for download from the NOSC’s SharePoint site at:  

## ENLISTED ADVANCEMENTS
- Promotions mean increase in pay, authority, prestige, responsibility, and retirement pay.  The Navy Advancement Center (https://wwwa.nko.navy.mil/portal/careermanagement/navyadvancementcenter/home) provides advancement in rate products and information. 
- Advancement depends on the needs of the Navy, performance, time-in-rate, advancement exam scores, and CO recommendations.  Time in Rate (TIR) is as follows: 
    E1 to E2: 9 months 			E5 to E6: 36 months
    E2 to E3: 9 months 			E6 to E7: 36 months
    E3 to E4: 6 months			E7 to E8: 36 months
    E4 to E5: 12 months			E8 to E9: 36 months
- Reservists may request a direct conversion to another rating without an examination if qualified for that rating.  Contact the Career Counselor for more information.
- Career Development Boards (CDB) provide enlisted Sailors the opportunity for optimal development of their professional skills, both military and technical, thereby enhancing unit readiness, individual upward mobility, job satisfaction and ultimately the retention of better-qualified Sailors.

## OFFICER PROMOTIONS
There are three elements to the officer promotion process: eligibility, selection, and promotion. Each element is controlled by laws, regulations, and administrative procedures. These are interrelated and driven by:
- Authorized strength- the number of officers in a particular category specified for a grade or combination of grades.
- Promotion flow point- the number of years of commissioned service at which most officers would be promoted to the next higher grade. 
- Promotion percentage- the number of officers in the promotion zone to be selected. These factors are interrelated and cannot be separated from each other. A change in one will force a change in the others.

## AWARDS

## ID CARDS & DEERS UPDATES
As a Reserve Component Member, you will be issued a common access card (CAC), which serves as your military identification card and your log-in card for the Navy’s computer system. Your eligible dependents are entitled to a dependent ID card through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).  An ID card allows your dependents access to military facilities if you are deployed or on active duty, but can also give them access to such day to day privileges as the commissary, exchange, and other benefits.  DEERS information is available through https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/deers/.
- ID Card Issuance:  ID cards can be issued from the NOSC or PSD. In cases where there is another branches military installation you may contact them about scheduling time to get into address DEERS/CAC assistance 
- DEERS Updates:  DEERS information needs to be updated immediately whenever you gain or lose a dependent into your family (marriage/divorce, birth/death, etc.) – this will enable them to receive military benefits and support if you are deployed.  Typically, you need to bring two forms of documentation of their status and identity to be scanned into DEERS – but it is best to call ahead with the intended issuing site and confirm what information is needed. To update your deers contact information, you may: 

1. make changes online through the Milconnect portal at https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/milconnect or Tricare at http://www.tricare.mil/DEERS. 
2. visit the NOSC, PSD or Military Installation 
3. call the Defense Manpower Data Center Support Office, (DSO) telephone center at 1-800-538-9552.

## NFAAS
Navy Family Accountability and Assessment System (NFAAS) (https://navyfamily.navy.mil/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fnavyfamily.navy.mil%2FNFMAuthN%2Fforms%2Fpublic%2Fpublic.jsp), standardizes a method for the Navy to account, assess, manage, and monitor the recovery process for personnel and their families affected and/or scattered by a wide-spread catastrophic event.  NFAAS provides valuable information to all levels of the Navy chain of command, allowing commanders to make strategic decisions, which facilitate a return to stability.  As a reservist, you must keep personal info in NFAAS up to date, and may need to use it to muster in the event of a region wide recall.

## FUNERAL HONORS
Military Funeral Honors are an entitlement for all honorably discharged Veterans.  The rendering of Military Funeral Honors for United States Armed Forces Veterans is a tribute that our Veterans and their families justly deserve and in fact, are now entitled to.  It is a way to show our Nation’s deep gratitude to those who, in times of war and peace, have faithfully defended our country.  The NOSC provides funeral honors details and reservists can earn points and pay by participating in these details.  If you are interested in supporting this program, please contact the Funeral Honors office regarding training and participation.
