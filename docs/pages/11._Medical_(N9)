# MEDICAL DEPARTMENT (N9)

All reservists are required to meet the Navy’s physical requirements.  Medical and Dental requirements will be passed down from your unit medical representative and can be verified by the individual on BOL under IMR.  The appointments list and unit 30,60, 90 day projections.  The NOSC Medical Department provides the following services:  Periodic Health Assessments (PHA), Dental exams (classification only), Immunizations, and all required Blood Work.  NOSC Medical is required to maintain all service treatment records, and manage hard hold orders in NROWS. **KEEP YOUR MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS UP TO DATE**!

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS
Reservists are required to have an annual physical exam, the Periodic Health Assessment, which includes vital signs, lab work, Health Risk Assessment, and Risk Factor Counseling by a medical officer.  All Navy personnel are required to keep their commanding officer and the Medical Department informed as to their general medical health.  

## DENTAL EXAMINATIONS
Reservists must have annual dental screenings, usually at the same time as the PHA.  Those who receive dental care from non-military dental providers can update their dental readiness by submitting the DD2813 Dental Examination form that has been completed by their dental providers.  The DD2813 is an editable PDF available on the NOSC SharePoint site, https://private.navyreserve.navy.mil/rcc/NRMA_GL/NOSC/Pages/NOSCNOSCMedical.aspx.  

## INJURY / ILLNESS DURING AN IDT WEEKEND OR ON ACTIVE DUTY
**If you are injured or become ill during a drill weekend, notify NOSC Medical immediately.  Care or treatment obtained during active duty orders also must be reported to the NOSC medical department for inclusion in your record, and to determine if follow up care may be required. Reservists can be reimbursed for expenses related to an injury or illness incurred during a drill weekend, or while otherwise under orders/travel status.**  This only applies to injury/illnesses that are determined to have occurred in the line of duty, and does not apply to pre-existing conditions.  More information about the Line of Duty program is available on the NOSC SharePoint site, https://private.navyreserve.navy.mil/rcc/NRMA_GL/NOSC/Pages/NOSCNOSCMedical.aspx, and at the PERS -95 website, http://www.public.navy.mil/BUPERS-NPC/CAREER/RESERVEPERSONNELMGMT/Pages/MEDHOLDLODPhysicalRiskPrograms.aspx.

## DENTAL CLASS 1-4/ TEMPORARILY NOT DENTALLY QUALIFIED (TNDQ) 
The dental readiness categories are:
- Dental Class 1 and Dental Class 2: Acceptable for Mobilization.
- Dental Class 3: A possibility for a dental emergency exists without medical intervention (such as a cavity).
- Dental Class 4: No current exam within 12 months or record is missing.  
If you are designated as Dental Class 3, you will be placed in a "temporarily not dentally qualified" (TNDQ) status until you are Dental Class 1 or Dental Class 2.  Dental treatment is at your own expense. 

## TNPQ
Reservists are responsible for reporting any injuries, illnesses, and diseases incurred at any time to the NOSC Medical Department.  Depending on the diagnosis, a Reservist may be placed in a Temporarily Not Physically Qualified (TNPQ) status. 
 
- TNPQ Drill Status. TNPQ and TNDQ status is used when a member has a medical or dental condition that is not service connected and is expected to be resolved in less than 180 days.  Members may be placed in a TNPQ drilling status if drilling will not reasonably be expected to complicate or aggravate the member’s injury/condition.  While in a TNPQ status, a member may not perform Annual Training (AT), Active Duty Training (ADT) or Inactive Duty Training Travel (IDTT).  Examples of minor disabilities are simple fractures, minor surgery, sprains, and strains. 
- TNPQ Non-Drill Status. When, in the opinion of the medical officer/MDR, a member has suffered a physical disqualification that exceeds the limitations of TNPQ Drilling, the member will be placed TNPQ Non-Drill. 
- Release from TNPQ Status.  When, in the opinion of the medical officer/MDR, with written documentation from a qualified physician, a member has fully recovered from the Illness/injury and is qualified to resume unrestricted drill status, the NOSC will return the individual back to unrestricted drill status. 

## NROWS HARD HOLDS FOR MEDICAL
A “Hard Hold” will prevent you from being issued orders in NROWS and is often generated by one or a combination of 3 medical requirements in NROWS not being current during the period a member is executing orders: 

**Check BUPERS** - IMR for tracking your medical status and needs. Also, check in with your NOSC Medical Dept. 
	

## DRUGS/ALCOHOL 
Prescribed medications must be documented in your health record.  If you are found to have certain drugs (which may also be presented as illicit/illegal drugs) in your urine and don't have the proper documentation, you may be subject to the UCMJ and administrative separation.  Alcohol use is not tolerated while on duty.  If you are having problems in your alcohol use/abuse, talk with your command Drug and Alcohol Program Advisor (DAPA) who can refer you to sources of help and counseling.

## MEDICAL/DENTAL INSURANCE
Unlike active component members, reservists may not normally receive care at a military treatment facility (MTF); they are responsible for their own medical and dental care and insurance.  Reserve members may be eligible for TRICARE coverage at various stages throughout their career, though.  Medical coverage is provided under the TRICARE Reserve Select program for non-mobilized Reservists who meet the eligibility criteria, or various transition programs available following a mobilization. Dental coverage can be obtained through the TRICARE Dental Plan.  For further information about each program visit http://www.tricare.mil.


## PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH OUTREACH PROGRAM (PHOP)
The mission of PHOP is to ensure that Reservists have full access to appropriate psychological health care services, to increase resilience, and to facilitate recovery, which is essential to maintaining a ready military force.  PHOP provides outreach calls to Reservists returning from deployment, de-stigmatize mental health care and maintenance and is confidential, free, and voluntary.  MIDWEST Region PHOP Team can be reached at 866-535-8538 ext 290/291.
