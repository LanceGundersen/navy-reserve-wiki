# TRAVEL DEPARTMENT (N3)

The Travel department processes all SELRES travel orders and travel-related issues, including Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) and travel claims.  All personnel in a Selected Reserve (SELRES) status are required to perform a minimum of 12 days of active duty Annual Training (AT) each fiscal year.  All AT/ADT/ADSW/IDTT must be done pursuant to approved orders.

## ORDER BASICS
Orders are issued to satisfy needs of the Navy, and must be approved in advance.  The member is on duty and travel status from the time of leaving home address until return.  The following are highlights of the different types of orders.
- AT – Annual Training: A period of active duty, typically 12 to 14 days in length.  AT is usually performed at a gaining command.  
- ADT – Active Duty Training: An additional period of active duty, which may be authorized for training, schools, or Fleet command support.  The unit CO must approve ADT, but funding comes from the command sponsoring the ADT.
- IDTT – Inactive Duty Training Travel.  These orders are for travel in an inactive duty status.  For instance, Cross Assigned (CA) personnel may use IDTT to perform a drill weekend that is not performed at their NOSC.  Example going to Cross Assigned Unit at a different NOSC.   IDTT can also be used for schools or operational support, but with restrictions.
- ADSW – Active Duty for Special Work:  An additional period of active duty that is longer than an ADT and is not processed through NROWS or by the travel department.  

## NAVAL RESERVE ORDER WRITING SYSTEM (NROWS)

All AT, ADT, and IDTT orders must go through NROWS. NROWS is a Web-enabled application used to apply, approve, and deliver orders.  NROWS is accessed at https://nrows.sscno.nmci.navy.mil/nrows.  NROWS is constantly being refined with new or altered data fields.  Pose any questions you have to your unit and then to NOSC Travel before contacting the NROWS Customer Support Center.

Some general guidelines and information:
- All NROWS requests should be completed and routed 30 days (60 days for OCONUS) prior to travel.  
- The travel itinerary, once orders are processed and approved, will be created by the Service member via DTS and then e-mailed to the member from SATO. The itinerary includes information about the flight, rental car, and lodging/berthing.  In some cases, the orders will not go through DTS, but only through SATO.
- If a SELRES encounters travel emergencies while in a travel status, a duty counselor is on call 24/7 to assist.  The toll free number is 1-800-537-4617, Option 1 and Option 1 again (it is also listed on the last page of each set of orders).  For assistance while not in a travel status, the member should contact the AT/ADT/IDTT coordinator at the NOSC. For after-hours emergencies, the member may also contact the SATO hotline at 1-800-359-9999 for travel assistance. SATO (also known as Sato Travel) is the government travel management firm with information accessible on the Web at http://www.satotravel.com.
- If there is a problem once on a travel status, do not pay for tickets or rent a car with your GTCC unless authorized by CNFRC N35.
- The member must have a GTCC and a valid driver’s license to obtain a rental car. Members are encouraged (and may be required) to carpool with other Navy Reservists while on duty, but must ensure that other drivers are listed on the rental car agreement.
- If you are on orders to an installation, you must use government lodging at that installation, if available, in order to be reimbursed (you may sometimes choose to stay off base at your own expense).  If government lodging is not available, then you must obtain a statement of non-availability (sometimes called a “CNA”, or Certificate of Non-Availability) from the BEQ/BOQ or you will NOT be reimbursed for lodging or get full per diem for meals.  If lodging arrangements have been made, information will be provided on the itinerary.  If no lodging information appears, call 800-865-7286, 0700-1500 (Monday-Friday) CST for accommodations.
- Anti-terrorism training (ATFP OCONUS) is required for overseas travel.  Orders will not be approved in NROWS unless ATFP training has been completed that year.
- NROWS does not catch all overseas travel requirements.   You must comply with the Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide (https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/).  Contact NOSC for any required changes to your travel itinerary or a modification to your orders. If you have a problem once you are in a travel status, contact SATO Emergency Travel at 1-877-583-8671.
- Frequent Flyer Miles:  The Fiscal Year 2002 National Defense Authorization Act allows travelers on official government orders to accept promotional items, including frequent flyer miles.  Government travelers cannot accept special promotional items that are not available to the general public.
- Members under orders are directed to report to the Commanding Officer of the designated command to get their orders endorsed. If for any reason you are unable to execute orders, immediately return them and any unused tickets to your NOSC noting the reason for return.
- SELRES are responsible for reading and understanding orders prior to execution.  Do not deviate from order authorizations.  If you require something that is not included in your orders, get the appropriate authorization before you deviate.  A failure to get proper authorization for expenses will result in non-reimbursement.  

## DEFENSE TRAVEL SYSTEM (DTS)
All SELRES are required to establish and maintain a DTS account at http://www.defensetravel.osd.mil.  All members assigned to NOSC shall be registered in DTS prior to submitting NROWS application.  For most orders, DTS will be used to arrange travel, lodging, rental cars, and advance pay; upon completion of travel, DTS will be used to submit the travel claim for reimbursement.  Detailed instructions on registering with DTS and using DTS are found on the NOSC SharePoint N3 Travel Dept. https://private.navyreserve.navy.mil/rcc/NRMA_GL/NOSC/Pages/NOSCNOSCOperations.aspx.  Review SharePoint for updated guidance.  

## TRAVEL CLAIMS
You have not fully executed your orders until you have submitted a travel claim via DTS or DD 1351-2 to NOSC Travel Department.   Current CNRFC policy requires that travel claims **MUST BE SUBMITTED WITH IN 5 days of the completion of Official Travel to your NOSC via DTS**.  The DTS Voucher will be automatically generated after the completion date of your travel; you must review and confirm the expenses (remember to add minor amounts like tolls, taxi fare, etc, that you may not have anticipated in your Authorization) and include CNA, if applicable.  In addition, you must scan and upload your ENDORSED orders and receipts for all expenses for which you are claiming reimbursement (if you do not have access to a scanner, contact NOSC Travel to make arrangements for fax or in-person submission).  You must submit all hotel room and rental car receipts, even if they are less than $75. 
- Typical expenses that may be claimed for reimbursement while on travel include: rental car (if authorized), fuel, parking, tolls, transportation to/from airport/lodging, transportation to/from lodging/duty place, international driver’s license if required for overseas AT, and other like charges.  Reimbursable expenses are claimed on the official travel claim.  You may reference the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) at http://www.dtic.mil/perdiem/jtr.html for more information.
- Per diem is calculated as follows: Per Diem Rate = Max Lodging + Meals + Incidentals.  Lodging will liquidate at the exact amount provided on receipt, up to the max rate for a specific city or area.  Meal reimbursement is dependent on government messing availability.
- For GTCC users, “split pay” is required to be used to the maximum extent possible.  Split-pay means that the reimbursing authority will pay you directly for your out-of-pocket expenses, but will also split your reimbursement and route some directly to the GTCC issuer in order to pay off amounts charged to the GTCC (typically, hotel, airfare, and rental car).

## GOVERNMENT TRAVEL CHARGE CARD (GTCC)
All personnel in a Selected Reserve (SELRES) status are required to use a Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) while on official travel.  The GTCC may only be used for official travel-related expenses.  GTCC currency exchange fees, if any, are reimbursable.  You are responsible for paying the GTCC bill on time or before it is due in full.  Prompt submission of your travel claim and the use of "Split Disbursement Option" will help you avoid delinquency and possible negative consequences.  Contact your Unit GTCC Agency Program Coordinator or visit the NOSC SharePoint https://private.navyreserve.navy.mil/rcc/NRMA_GL/NOSC/Pages/NOSCNOSCOperations.aspx.   All GTCC cardholders must complete training and complete a GTCC Pg. 13.  Note: This credit card is applied to your personal credit score/rating.  Adverse consequences can occur for extended failure to pay - NOSC will begin taking administrative actions at the 30-60-90 day overdue marks.
   
## PAY
Your active duty pay will be processed by the PSD listed on your orders after your orders are endorsed.  Check the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) MyPay site (https://mypay.dfas.mil/mypay.aspx) to find the status of your pay and allowances.

## COUNTRY/THEATRE/AREA CLEARANCES
If you receive orders to a location outside the United States, the foreign clearance guide (https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/) may instruct you to obtain a country clearance, theatre clearance and/or special area clearance.  If you need one or more of these clearances, please contact your unit security assistant who will provide you with a country clearance request form.  You will need to complete the form in its entirety and send it to your security assistant and they will submit the request to NOSC’s security manager’s office.  Please submit these requests a minimum of 45 days prior to your scheduled departure from the U.S. in order to meet the deadlines required by the foreign clearance guide.  If unable to do so, you must provide detailed reasons for missing the deadlines (i.e., short-fused orders).
