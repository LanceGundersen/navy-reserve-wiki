# RESERVE PAY, TSP & INSURANCE

## Drill Process Time: DRILL PAY
Processed through direct deposit and should be in your account within three weeks after a drill. Your leave and earning statement (LES) should be on Mypay at https://mypay.dfas.mil/mypay.aspx around the same time. If you donâ€™t receive an LES or the correct pay in this time frame, contact your unit pay coordinator. Manpower department normal handles all drill pay. Make sure you were mustered and that the pay has been processed by your manpower department for drills.

## Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)
Is a retirement savings plan that offers the same type of savings and tax benefits that many private corporations offer their employees under "401(k)" or similar plans. Voluntary contributions to the TSP can be deducted from your reserve pay. For information visit https://www.tsp.gov/index.shtml.

## Service Member's Group Life Insurance (SGLI)
Reservists can purchase up to $400,000 of full-time coverage.  Enrollment is automatic for SELRES unless the reservist chooses lesser amounts of coverage or declines coverage.  If life insurance is purchased, dependent children are provided coverage for $10,000 at no charge, and the member is covered by Traumatic Injury Protection.  TSGLI is disability compensation for serious injury and loss of limbs up to $100,000.  Spousal life insurance up to $100,000 is also available at additional cost.
